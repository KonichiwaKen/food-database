# SnackTrack: Food point calculator and food trend analyzer #

https://snacktrack-316.herokuapp.com

Course project for Database Systems class. Our webapp helps student figure out meal options given their current food point balance as well as any dietary restrictions they may have. Based on what students' decide to eat, we will then be calculating food trends on campus and presenting that data to the user. There will be two main datasets that we will be analyzing: food served on campus and students' eating habits. With the first dataset, we will store data on the food served on campus. We store nutritional information, ingredients (lactose intolerant, gluten-free, etc), location served, and cost. The second dataset will be students' eating habits on campus. We will be tracking what foods people are eating, where they are eating, when they are eating those foods, and other assorted info. We will then use this info to visualize trends on campus.

### Future plans ###

* Add suggested food items to food point calculator based on what's currently trending
* Make food items page easily searchable
* Have user accounts to store food point balances and dietary info
* Add ability to login to get food point value or include link to easily navigate to Duke Card website
