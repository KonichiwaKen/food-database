# Analyzing Food Trends on Campus #

Course project for Database Systems class. We will be analyzing food trends on campus and presenting the data in a webapp. There will be two main datasets that we will be analyzing: food served on campus and students' eating habits. With the first dataset, we will store data on the food served on campus. We will be storing nutritional information, ingredients (lactose intolerant, gluten-free, etc), location served, cost, time available, type of food (e.g. breakfast, dinner, snack, etc). We will use this data to give food recommendations to the user based on how many food points they have left, what their dietary restrictions are, where they are willing to travel to to eat, and other associated info. The second dataset will be students' eating habits on campus. We will be tracking what foods people are eating, where they are eating, when they are eating those foods, and other assorted info. We will then use this info to visualize trends on campus and to make eating recommendations for the user.
